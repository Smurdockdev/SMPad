### Description
This is my little notepad that I created with Python.

### Information
This is my little notepad that I created with Python. I am trying to learn tkinter and making GUIs. This represents my first Python GUI. I cobbled this together after watching a couple tutorials.

I know this does not seem like much but I got a lot out of it; and I also stated using Git and Github finally.
Any suggestions on my first project, just let me know. I would appreciate the feedback. Again, I am a beginner.
